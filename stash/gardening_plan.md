## 3. Soil Preparation and Fertilization

*   **Soil Testing:** Start with a soil test to determine pH and nutrient levels.  Washington State University Extension offers soil testing services.
*   **Amendments:**
    *   **Compost:**  Incorporate plenty of compost (aged manure, leaf mold, kitchen scraps) to improve soil structure, drainage, and fertility. Add compost annually.
    *   **Acidic Soil for Blueberries:**  Blueberries need a pH of 4.5-5.5. Amend soil heavily with peat moss, sulfur, or azalea/rhododendron fertilizer if your soil is not acidic enough.
    *   **Lime:**  If your soil is too acidic for other vegetables, add lime to raise the pH. Follow soil test recommendations.
*   **Fertilization:**
    *   **Organic Fertilizers:** Use organic fertilizers such as bone meal (phosphorus), blood meal (nitrogen), kelp meal (potassium and trace minerals), and fish emulsion.
    *   **Crop-Specific Needs:**  Tomatoes and peppers benefit from fertilizers higher in phosphorus. Leafy greens need more nitrogen.
    *   **Avoid Over-Fertilizing:**  Too much nitrogen can lead to excessive foliage growth at the expense of fruit production.
*   **Mulching:**  Apply a layer of organic mulch (straw, wood chips, shredded leaves) to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

## 4. Pest and Disease Control (Organic)

*   **Prevention is Key:**
    *   **Healthy Soil:** Start with healthy soil and strong plants.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops each year to prevent soil-borne diseases and pest buildup.
    *   **Good Air Circulation:**  Space plants appropriately to allow for good air circulation, reducing fungal diseases.
    *   **Watering Practices:**  Water at the base of plants, not overhead, to prevent fungal diseases.  Water in the morning so foliage dries during the day.
*   **Pest Control:**
    *   **Handpicking:**  Remove pests (slugs, snails, cabbage worms) by hand.
    *   **Floating Row Covers:**  Protect young plants from insect pests like flea beetles and cabbage moths.
    *   **Neem Oil:**  A broad-spectrum organic insecticide and fungicide. Apply as needed.
    *   **Insecticidal Soap:** Effective against aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects.
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt):**  Effective against cabbage worms and other caterpillars.
    *   **Diatomaceous Earth (DE):**  Sprinkle around plants to control slugs, snails, and other crawling insects. (Food Grade)
    *   **Beneficial Insects:**  Attract beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps) to your garden by planting flowers that provide nectar and pollen.
*   **Disease Control:**
    *   **Copper Fungicide:** Use as a preventative measure for fungal diseases like blight and powdery mildew.
    *   **Baking Soda Spray:**  Mix baking soda with water and a small amount of liquid soap to control powdery mildew.
    *   **Remove Infected Plants:**  Promptly remove and destroy any plants showing signs of disease to prevent it from spreading.

## 5. Suggested Varieties and Seed Sources

*   **High Mowing Seeds:** [https://www.highmowingseeds.com/](https://www.highmowingseeds.com/) - Offers a wide selection of certified organic seeds.
*   **Johnny's Selected Seeds:** [https://www.johnnyseeds.com/](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/) - Reputable company with detailed variety information.
*   **Territorial Seed Company:** [https://territorialseed.com/](https://territorialseed.com/) - Located in Oregon and specializes in varieties suitable for the Pacific Northwest.
*   **Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds:** [https://www.rareseeds.com/](https://www.rareseeds.com/) - Excellent source for heirloom and unusual varieties.

**Suggested Varieties (Examples - Check Seed Catalogs for More Options):**

*   **Tomato:**  'Early Girl' (early, reliable), 'Roma' (determinate, good for sauce), 'Brandywine' (heirloom flavor).
*   **Pepper:**  'California Wonder' (bell pepper), 'Jalapeño' (hot pepper), 'Italian Sweet' (sweet pepper).
*   **Zucchini:**  'Black Beauty' (reliable, productive).
*   **Cucumber:** 'Marketmore 76' (slicing), 'National Pickling' (pickling).
*   **Lettuce:** 'Buttercrunch' (butterhead), 'Black Seeded Simpson' (loose leaf).
*   **Kale:** 'Lacinato' (dinosaur kale), 'Red Russian' (cold-hardy).
*   **Blueberry:** 'Bluecrop' (reliable, mid-season), 'Elliott' (late-season).
*   **Raspberry:** 'Heritage' (everbearing).
*   **Strawberry:** 'Albion' (everbearing), 'Hood' (June bearing - well suited to the Pacific NW)

## 6. Maximizing Space

*   **Vertical Gardening:**
    *   **Trellises:** Use trellises for cucumbers, pole beans, tomatoes (indeterminate varieties), and squash.
    *   **Hanging Baskets:**  Grow herbs, strawberries, and cherry tomatoes in hanging baskets.
    *   **Living Walls:**  Create a living wall using pallets or other structures.
*   **Companion Planting:**
    *   **Tomatoes & Basil:** Basil repels tomato hornworms and other pests.
    *   **Carrots & Onions:** Onions repel carrot root flies, and carrots repel onion flies.
    *   **Beans & Corn:**  The "Three Sisters" method - corn provides a trellis for beans, beans fix nitrogen in the soil, and squash shades the soil to retain moisture.
    *   **Marigolds:** Plant marigolds throughout the garden to repel nematodes and other pests.
*   **Succession Planting:** Plant crops in succession to maximize yields throughout the growing season.  For example, after harvesting lettuce, plant bush beans in the same space.
*   **Intercropping:** Fill in the spaces between larger plants with smaller, faster-growing crops like radishes or lettuce.

## 7. Layout Plan (Example – Adjust to Your Garden's Orientation)

This is a *sample* layout plan, and you'll need to adapt it based on your garden's size, shape, and sun exposure.

```
North
      ------------------------------------
      |  Trellised Crops (Pole Beans, Cucumbers) |
      ------------------------------------
      | Tall Crops (Corn, Sunflowers)          |
      ------------------------------------
      | Tomatoes (Trellised/Staked)           |
      ------------------------------------
      | Peppers, Eggplant                     |
      ------------------------------------
      | Squash, Zucchini                      |
      ------------------------------------
      | Leafy Greens (Lettuce, Spinach)       |
      ------------------------------------
      | Root Crops (Carrots, Beets, Radishes) |
      ------------------------------------
      | Herbs (Basil, Parsley, Mint - in containers)   |
      ------------------------------------
      | Berries (along a fence, if possible) |
      ------------------------------------
South
```

*   **Sunlight:**  Plant taller crops (corn, trellised tomatoes) on the north side of the garden to avoid shading smaller plants.
*   **Accessibility:**  Leave pathways between rows for easy access to plants.
*   **Crop Rotation:**  Plan your layout to facilitate crop rotation in subsequent years.
*   **Perennial Plants:**  Place perennial crops (berries, fruit trees) in areas where they won't interfere with annual crop rotation.  Consider proximity to water source.
*   **Microclimates**: Observe your yard for sunny and shaded areas prior to planting. Use warmer areas for heat-loving plants and shadier spots for cool-weather crops.
