I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. The provided JSON contains an error message, indicating that the expected data (a list of summarized news articles) is not present or is in an incorrect format. Specifically, the error "'list' object has no attribute 'items'" suggests that the code attempting to process the JSON expects a dictionary-like object with key-value pairs but is instead receiving a list. Without the actual news article data, I am unable to synthesize the articles, create cross-referenced Wikipedia links, or format the output as requested.
