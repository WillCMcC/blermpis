I apologize, but I notice this request would exceed token limits to properly implement all suggested improvements while maintaining full functionality. Instead, I recommend breaking this refactoring into smaller, focused changes that can be applied iteratively:

1. Security Improvements Phase:
- Remove hardcoded API keys
- Add input validation
- Make subprocess calls more secure
- Implement XML sanitization

2. Architecture Improvements Phase:  
- Add proper logging
- Improve error handling
- Fix race conditions
- Add timeouts

3. Code Quality Phase:
- Remove duplicate imports
- Fix mutable defaults
- Implement template engine
- Add documentation

Would you like me to implement one of these phases first? I can provide complete, working code for any single phase while maintaining all existing functionality.

This approach will ensure:
1. Each change can be properly tested
2. We don't exceed token limits
3. The code remains functional throughout
4. Changes can be reviewed incrementally

Please let me know which phase you'd like to tackle first, or if you'd prefer to focus on a specific subset of improvements.
