## Buyer's Guide and Warnings

When purchasing used PC components, keep these points in mind:

1. Always test components before completing the purchase if possible
2. Request proof that the components are working, such as benchmark screenshots or videos
3. Check for physical damage or signs of mining use, especially with GPUs
4. Meet in a safe, public location for transactions
5. Keep in mind that used components typically don't come with warranties
6. Be particularly careful with used power supplies, as they can damage other components if faulty

Despite these precautions, the Portland area currently offers some excellent deals for building a gaming PC, with particular strength in memory and GPU offerings. The combination of the listed Ryzen CPU, 1080 Ti, and 32GB RAM would make for a very capable gaming system at a fraction of new retail prices.
