# Best PC Gaming Deals in Portland - Craigslist Market Analysis

After analyzing 202 Craigslist listings in the Portland area, I've identified several compelling deals for PC gaming components. This analysis focuses on price-to-performance ratio, comparing current market values against listing prices to identify the best opportunities for budget-conscious builders.

## MSI GeForce RTX Graphics Card

**Price: $1,900**

This listing requires careful attention. There appears to be a typo in the title (RTX 5080), and the actual card could be either an RTX 4080 or 4090. If it's a 4090, this is a good deal as these typically sell for $2,000-2,200. However, if it's a 4080, the price is at market rate. Potential buyers should verify the exact model before proceeding.

## AMD Ryzen 3600

**Price: $45**

This is an exceptional deal for a Ryzen 5 3600. These CPUs typically sell used for $80-100, making this price point particularly attractive. While it's an older CPU, it still offers 6 cores/12 threads and is perfectly capable of handling modern gaming when paired with a suitable GPU. At $45, this is one of the best price-to-performance ratios currently available.

## Nvidia Quadro Professional GPUs

**Price: $150**

While these Quadro cards are primarily designed for professional workstations, they can serve as capable gaming GPUs for older titles. The P2000, in particular, performs similarly to a GTX 1060. At $150, this is a fair price but mainly recommended for users who might benefit from professional features alongside light gaming.

## EVGA 1080ti FTW3

**Price: $180**

The GTX 1080 Ti remains a capable 1440p gaming card, and the FTW3 is one of EVGA's premium models with better cooling and power delivery. At $180, this matches current market rates. While not a steal, it's a fair price for a card that can still handle modern games at high settings.

## Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB DDR4-3600
[Link to Listing](https://portland.craigslist.org/clk/sop/d/kelso-32gb-ddr4-3600mhz-corsair/7818610302.html)  
**Price: $50**

This is arguably the best deal in the current listings. 32GB of DDR4-3600 memory typically sells for $90-120 used, making this an exceptional value. The Vengeance LPX is a reliable series with good compatibility, and 3600MHz is an ideal speed for modern gaming systems.

# Conclusion and Warnings

When purchasing used hardware, always:
- Test components before completing the transaction if possible
- Meet in a safe, public location
- Request proof of functioning condition (screenshots/videos)
- Check for physical damage or signs of mining use on GPUs
- Verify exact model numbers on-site

The Portland market currently shows some promising deals, particularly in the CPU and RAM categories. The GPU market remains relatively consistent with national used pricing trends, but careful shopping can still yield good value.
