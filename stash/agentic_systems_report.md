### 1. Efficient Lindblad synthesis for noise model construction

*   **Title:** Efficient Lindblad synthesis for noise model construction
*   **Authors:** Moein Malekakhlagh, Alireza Seif, Daniel Puzzuoli, Luke C. G. Govia, Ewout van den Berg
*   **Summary:** This paper presents a method for constructing effective noise models for quantum systems, crucial for quantum error mitigation and correction. It uses the Magnus expansion and Dyson series to build a model from a Lindbladian description of physical noise processes acting concurrently with the desired gate operation. The approach can be used for symbolic or numerical approximations of the noise channel of a multi-qubit quantum gate. Use cases include computing noise channels from learned Lindbladians and generating noise channels from physically motivated Lindbladians. Results show strong agreement between symbolic noise construction and full numerical Lindblad simulations, providing insights into the interplay of noise and gate operations.

### 2. Learning dissipation and instability fields from chaotic dynamics

*   **Title:** Learning dissipation and instability fields from chaotic dynamics
*   **Authors:** Ludovico T Giorgini, Andre N Souza, Domenico Lippolis, Predrag Cvitanović, Peter Schmid
*   **Summary:** The paper explores how to reliably determine instability fields or local dissipation rates in chaotic systems. It offers an alternative route by estimating the Jacobian of a discrete-time dynamical system locally from the entries of the transition matrix that approximates the Perron-Frobenius operator for a given state-space partition. Numerical tests on one- and two-dimensional chaotic maps show promising results.

### 3. A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)

*   **Title:** A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)
*   **Authors:** Yiye Chen, Harpreet Sawhney, Nicholas Gydé, Yanan Jian, Jack Saunders, Patricio Vela, Ben Lundell
*   **Summary:** This paper introduces SG-RwR, a framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs). It employs two LLM agents: a Reasoner for task planning and a Retriever to extract graph information. The agents collaborate iteratively, using scene graph schema rather than full graph data to reduce hallucination. The Retriever programmatically queries the scene graph data, enabling dynamic and global attention to the graph. Experiments show that the framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical question answering and planning tasks.

### 4. High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$

*   **Title:** High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$
*   **Authors:** Christopher Broyles, Xiaohan Wan, Wenting Cheng, Dingsong Wu, Hengxin Tan, Qiaozhi Xu, Shannon L. Gould, Hasan Siddiquee, Leyan Xiao, Ryan Chen, Wanyue Lin, Yuchen Wu, Prakash Regmi, Yun Suk Eo, Jieyi Liu, Yulin Chen, Binghai Yan, Kai Sun, Sheng Ran
*   **Summary:** The study reports on the Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Transport measurements show a surface state that emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K. The surface conductivity is significantly higher than the bulk at low temperatures, suggesting an inherently protected surface state. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$, will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators.

### 5. Designing LLM-simulated Immersive Spaces to Enhance Autistic Children's Social Affordances Understanding

*   **Title:** Designing LLM-simulated Immersive Spaces to Enhance Autistic Children's Social Affordances Understanding
*   **Authors:** Yancheng Cao, Yangyang HE, Yonglin Chen, Menghan Chen, Shanhe You, Yulin Qiu, Min Liu, Chuan Luo, Chen Zheng, Xin Tong, Jing Liang, Jiangtao Gong
*   **Summary:** The researchers developed an LLM-simulated immersive projection environment (AIroad) to improve autistic children's understanding of social affordances, specifically regarding social signals in traffic scenarios.  The system leverages LLMs to simulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through multimodal social signals. A user study with 14 participants showed significant improvements in their understanding of social affordances, and parents reported high perceived usability.
