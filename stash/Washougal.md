*   **Location:** Have new beds prepared and ready to go.  Sheet composting or adding compost is ideal between crops.

*   **Examples (Based on Original Data):**

    *   **Peas -> Bush Beans -> Garlic:**  Plant peas in early spring. After pea harvest (June), replace with bush beans.  After bean harvest (September), plant garlic for next year's harvest.

    *   **Lettuce/Carrots -> More Carrots -> Cover Crop:** Interplant fast-growing lettuce with carrots. When lettuce is harvested, plant more carrots. After carrot harvest, plant a cover crop (e.g., crimson clover) to improve soil.

    *   **Tomatoes -> Fall Greens:** Plant tomatoes in May.  In August, start fall greens (kale, spinach, lettuce) between the tomato plants.  When tomatoes are removed (October), the greens will take over.

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops each year to prevent the buildup of soilborne pests and diseases.

*   **Companion Planting:** Use companion planting to deter pests and attract beneficial insects.

*   **Watering Practices:** Water deeply and infrequently, and avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases.

*   **Weed Control:** Remove weeds regularly to prevent them from competing with crops for nutrients and water, and from harboring pests and diseases. Mulch to help reduce weeds.

*   **Sanitation:** Remove diseased plant material promptly to prevent the spread of disease. Clean up garden debris at the end of the season.

*   **Beneficial Insects:** Attract beneficial insects (ladybugs, lacewings, parasitic wasps) to the garden to control pests. Plant flowers that attract beneficial insects (yarrow, dill, fennel, cilantro).

*   **Handpicking:** Pick off pests (cucumber beetles, cabbage worms) by hand and drop them into a bucket of soapy water.

*   **Row Covers:** Use row covers to protect crops from pests and diseases.

*   **Slug and Snail Control:** Use beer traps, copper tape, diatomaceous earth, or handpick them at night.

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Use a combination of methods to control pests and diseases, minimizing the use of harmful pesticides. Only use pesticides as a last resort, and choose organic options whenever possible.

*   **Disease-Resistant Varieties:** Select disease-resistant varieties of plants when available.

*   **Spacing:** Allow adequate spacing between plants to provide good air circulation and reduce the risk of disease.

*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for signs of pests and diseases.
