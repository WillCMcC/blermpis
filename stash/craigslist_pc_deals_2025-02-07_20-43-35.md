[View Listing](https://portland.craigslist.org/clk/sop/d/vancouver-ryzen-7500f-rtx-gaming/7814272042.html)

This is potentially the best overall value in the current market. A complete gaming system at $450 represents exceptional value, considering the Ryzen platform alone typically commands $200-300. The inclusion of an RTX card (specific model not mentioned) makes this an excellent starting point for gaming. New builders should prioritize investigating this listing, though thorough testing of all components is recommended.

### EVGA 1080ti FTW3 Video Card
**Price: $180**

The GTX 1080 Ti remains a capable gaming card in 2023. This FTW3 variant from EVGA is particularly desirable due to its superior cooling solution and build quality. At $180, it's about 10% below typical market price. The card performs similarly to an RTX 2070 in many games and can still handle 1440p gaming effectively. The 11GB VRAM buffer remains relevant for modern titles.

### Dell 1.6TB NVMe SSD
**Price: $80**

Enterprise-grade NVMe storage at $0.05 per GB is an exceptional value. While this drive may have some wear from server use, enterprise SSDs are typically built with higher endurance ratings than consumer drives. Even with some use, this represents a 33% discount compared to similar capacity drives on the used market.

### 32GB DDR4 3600MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX
**Price: $50**

High-speed DDR4 memory at this capacity typically sells for $75-100 used. Corsair Vengeance LPX is a reliable brand with good compatibility across most motherboards. The 3600MHz speed is ideal for Ryzen systems, and this price point represents significant savings for builders looking to maximize their RAM capacity.

### AMD FirePro W7100 DDR5 8GB GPU
**Price: $60**

While not ideal for gaming, this workstation card offers excellent value for content creators or those needing GPU computing power. The 8GB VRAM buffer is generous at this price point, though buyers should note that driver support may be limited for newer applications.

## Conclusion and Warnings

When purchasing used PC components, buyers should:

- Test all components thoroughly before completing the purchase
- Be wary of mining-used GPUs, which may have reduced lifespan
- Request proof of functionality through benchmarks or stress tests
- Check for physical damage or signs of improper maintenance
- Consider the age of components when negotiating prices

The Portland market currently shows strong value in the mid-range segment, particularly for complete systems and storage components. The availability of enterprise hardware at consumer prices presents unique opportunities for budget-conscious builders.
