### 1. A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)

*   **Title:** A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)
*   **Authors:** Yiye Chen, Harpreet Sawhney, Nicholas Gyd√©, Yanan Jian, Jack Saunders, Patricio Vela, Ben Lundell
*   **Summary:** This paper presents a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason (SG-RwR) framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach uses two LLM agents: a Reasoner for task planning and query generation, and a Retriever for extracting graph information. Both agents are prompted with the scene graph schema, rather than the full graph, to reduce hallucination.  The Reasoner generates a reasoning trace, and the Retriever programmatically queries the scene graph data based on the schema. Experiments show the framework outperforms existing LLM-based approaches. The project code will be released.

### 2. Linearized Optimal Transport pyLOT Library: A Toolkit for Machine Learning on Point Clouds

*   **Title:** Linearized Optimal Transport pyLOT Library: A Toolkit for Machine Learning on Point Clouds
*   **Authors:** Jun Linwu, Varun Khurana, Nicholas Karris, Alexander Cloninger
*   **Summary:** The pyLOT library provides a Python implementation of linearized optimal transport (LOT) techniques for downstream machine learning tasks. The pipeline embeds probability distributions into a Hilbert space via Optimal Transport maps from a fixed reference distribution allowing downstream tasks to be completed using off the shelf (linear) machine learning algorithms. The paper includes a case study of performing ML on 3D scans of lemur teeth.

### 3. Harnessing Large Language Models for Curated Code Reviews

*   **Title:** Harnessing Large Language Models for Curated Code Reviews
*   **Authors:** Oussama Ben Sghaier, Martin Weyssow, Houari Sahraoui
*   **Summary:** This paper addresses the challenge of noisy and unrefined code review datasets, which limit the effectiveness of AI-based comment generation. The authors propose a curation pipeline, using a large language model (LLM), to enhance the quality of a publicly available code review dataset by improving the clarity and conciseness of the comments. The curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments and helps in code refinement.

### 4. Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators

*   **Title:** Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators
*   **Authors:** Yuan Xinjie, Khalid M. Mosalam
*   **Summary:** This paper introduces a novel framework for predicting the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) in building structures using a neural network-based approach. It integrates fire dynamics and finite element analysis through a differentiable agent model. The framework predicts the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) using graph neural networks and transfer learning. The proposed model demonstrates strong performance in predicting both MIDR and MFSP, advancing fire safety analysis for building structures.

### 5. Energy-Efficient Flying LoRa Gateways: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach

*   **Title:** Energy-Efficient Flying LoRa Gateways: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach
*   **Authors:** Abdullahi Isa Ahmed, El Mehdi Amhoud
*   **Summary:**  This paper focuses on maximizing the global system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by jointly optimizing transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W), and end device (ED) association, using flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and solved using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that the proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly improves the global system EE.
