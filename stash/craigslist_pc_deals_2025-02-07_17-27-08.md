# Buying Used PC Hardware - Important Considerations

1. Always test components before completing the purchase if possible
2. Check for mining usage, especially with GPUs
3. Request proof that components are functioning
4. Examine components for physical damage or signs of overheating
5. Meet in a safe, public location for transactions
