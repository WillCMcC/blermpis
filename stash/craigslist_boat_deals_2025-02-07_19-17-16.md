# Best Boat Deals on Craigslist - Portland Area

After analyzing 138 Craigslist listings in the Portland area, I've identified several standout deals based on price-to-value ratio, condition, and market comparison. Each selection was evaluated against current market prices and historical sales data to ensure they represent genuine value for potential buyers.

## 1987 SEARAY Boat with cabin

**Price: $1,500**

This represents an exceptional value for anyone looking to enter cabin boating. Similar Sea Ray models from this era typically sell for $3,000-5,000 even in fair condition. While age is a consideration, Sea Ray's build quality from this period was notably good, and the cabin feature alone makes this a steal at this price point. The cost of comparable cabin cruisers in today's market starts at $7,000+.

## Old Town Otter 9' Kayak w/paddle

**Price: $150**

Old Town is a premium kayak manufacturer, and the Otter model typically retails new for $450-500. At $150 including a paddle (which can cost $50-100 alone), this represents significant savings. The 9-foot length makes it ideal for recreational use and easy transport. These kayaks are known for their durability, making used models a smart investment.

## Dagger Crossfire 11' Kayak w/skirt,floats

**Price: $80**

This is an extraordinary deal for a Dagger kayak. The Crossfire model, while older, is a respected design that originally retailed for around $800. The inclusion of a skirt and floats (combined value of $100+) makes this an even better value. At under $100, this is an incredible entry point for someone interested in kayaking.

## 2021 ULTRASKIFF 360 with Bomber Wrap

**Price: $1,450**

The ULTRASKIFF 360 is a relatively new and innovative design in the boating world. At $1,450 for a 2021 model with Bomber Wrap (which adds durability and value), this is competitively priced. New models retail for $2,000+, making this a good deal for a nearly new vessel with premium features.

## Buyer's Notes and Warnings

When purchasing used boats, always consider:
- Request a thorough inspection, especially for powered vessels
- Check for registration and title documentation
- Verify hull identification numbers
- Test all included equipment
- For older boats, factor in potential maintenance costs
- Always inspect for water damage or structural issues before purchase

The current market offers particularly good value in the kayak segment, with several listings well below retail. Cabin boats, while requiring more due diligence, also show some strong opportunities for value purchases.
