This complete system represents excellent value, primarily due to the inclusion of an RTX 3070 graphics card. The RTX 3070 alone typically sells for $350-400 on the used market, making this a compelling deal. The system's Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, while not the newest, is still a capable gaming processor that pairs well with the 3070. When factoring in the motherboard, case, power supply, and other components (worth approximately $200-250), this system offers significant savings compared to building new.

### RTX 3080
**Price: $500**

This is a particularly attractive deal for a high-end graphics card. The RTX 3080 remains one of the most capable gaming GPUs available, and this price is at the lower end of the current used market range ($450-550). For context, this card still delivers excellent 4K gaming performance and supports all modern features like DLSS and ray tracing.

### i7-10700k
**Price: $150**

The i7-10700k is still a very capable gaming CPU with 8 cores and 16 threads, making it suitable for both gaming and productivity tasks. While it's not the latest generation, it offers strong performance that will satisfy most gamers' needs.
