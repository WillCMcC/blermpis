**Technical Specification Document: AI-Powered Content Reminder and Suggestion Service for Comedians and Podcasters**

**1. Introduction (Page 1)**

*   **1.1. Purpose:** This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, and technical details for an AI-powered content reminder and suggestion service designed for comedians and podcasters.  It serves as a guide for development, testing, deployment, and maintenance activities.
*   **1.2. Target Audience:** This document is intended for backend, frontend, and AI/ML developers; QA engineers; DevOps engineers; product managers; and stakeholders. Specifically, backend developers should refer to Sections 3 and 4 for API specifications and data models.
*   **1.3. Scope:** The service will include automatic YouTube ingestion, stand-up clip management, AI-driven content suggestion, and social media integration (initially Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook).  Video editing and direct monetization support are explicitly excluded. A free tier will be available, limited to a specified number of connected YouTube channels (e.g., 3).
*   **1.4. Goals and Objectives:** This project aims to automate content repurposing, particularly through AI. We aim to suggest at least three relevant social media posts per week, resulting in a minimum 15% increase in average social media engagement within 6 months of launch.

    **Quantifiable Objectives:**

    *   Support integration with at least 3 social media platforms.
    *   Achieve content suggestion response times under 1 second.
    *   Maintain a system uptime of 99.9%.
    *   Attract 10,000 users within the first year of operation.
