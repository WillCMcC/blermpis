    *   **Web Engineering:**  Fundamental for building the interactive platform, handling data loading, rendering, and user interactions. Key for developing a smooth and intuitive user experience.
    *   **3D/Medical Imaging (adapted):**  The sophisticated data visualization techniques commonly used in medical imaging (e.g., volume rendering, isosurface extraction) are adapted to visualize abstract datasets in meaningful ways.
    *   **LLM:** Powers the AI assistant to suggest story narratives, propose visualizations, and generate insightful captions for elements. It can also dynamically generate insights based on user interactions with the data.

**3.  AI-Assisted 3D Model Repair and Optimization Tool**

*   **Description:** A web-based platform that automatically identifies and repairs errors in 3D models, particularly focused on models sourced from diverse and often unreliable sources (e.g., user-generated content sites, reverse engineering).
