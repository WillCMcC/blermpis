## Buying Used Hardware - Important Considerations

When purchasing used PC components, keep these tips in mind:
- Always test components before finalizing the purchase if possible
- Request proof of functionality, such as benchmark screenshots or videos
- Check for physical damage or signs of mining use on GPUs
- Verify warranty status and transfer eligibility
- Meet in a safe, public location for the transaction
- Consider the lack of warranty support when evaluating prices against new components

Overall, these listings represent good opportunities for budget-conscious builders, but as with any used hardware purchase, proper due diligence is essential.
