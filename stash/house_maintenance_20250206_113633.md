## Maintaining the Legacy: A Guide to 1947 Washington State Homes

This guide provides essential information for maintaining homes built in Washington State around 1947, addressing common issues and offering practical maintenance advice to preserve these historic residences while ensuring modern comfort and safety.

**II. Common Issues in 1947 Washington Houses**

Houses built in Washington state during 1947 present several characteristic challenges due to their age, construction methods, and materials common to the post-World War II building boom.

**A. Foundation Problems**

-   Prevalent use of unreinforced concrete foundations, which are susceptible to cracking
-   Settlement issues due to poor soil compaction practices of the era
-   Inadequate waterproofing methods leading to basement moisture problems
-   Limited foundation ventilation causing crawl space dampness
-   Deteriorating concrete due to prolonged exposure to Washington's wet climate

**B. Plumbing Concerns**

-   Original galvanized steel pipes reaching end of service life (75+ years)
-   Corroded pipes leading to reduced water pressure and rusty water
-   Lead solder in pipe joints (common until 1986)
-   Cast iron waste pipes suffering from internal rust and deterioration
-   Outdated pipe sizing not meeting modern flow requirements
-   Tree root infiltration in clay sewer lines

**C. Electrical System Weaknesses**

-   Original knob-and-tube wiring still present in many homes
-   Inadequate 60-amp service panels (modern standard is 200-amp)
-   Ungrounded two-prong outlets throughout the house
-   Limited number of electrical outlets per room
-   Fabric-covered wiring with deteriorating insulation
-   No GFCI protection in wet areas

**D. Insulation Deficiencies**

-   Minimal or no wall cavity insulation
-   Newspaper or sawdust used as insulation in some areas
-   Poor attic insulation (typically R-11 or less)
-   No vapor barriers in walls or crawl spaces
-   Air leakage around windows and doors
-   Inadequate ventilation in attic spaces

**E. Roofing and Gutter Deterioration**

-   Original cedar shake roofs beyond lifespan
-   Undersized gutters for Washington's heavy rainfall
-   Deteriorating fascia boards due to constant moisture exposure
-   Inadequate roof ventilation leading to mold and rot
-   Limited roof overhangs providing insufficient protection
-   Original flashing materials failing around chimneys and vents

**F. Window and Door Inefficiency**

-   Single-pane windows with deteriorating putty
-   Poorly fitting wooden window frames
-   Draft-prone wooden doors with minimal weatherstripping
-   Obsolete hardware and locking mechanisms
-   Rotting window sills due to water exposure
-   Steel casement windows with failing operating mechanisms

**G. Presence of Hazardous Materials**

-   Lead-based paint on interior and exterior surfaces (banned in 1978)
-   Asbestos in:
    *   Floor tiles (9x9 inch tiles common in 1947)
    *   Pipe insulation
    *   Ceiling textures
    *   Siding materials
    *   Furnace duct wrap
-   Mercury in old thermostats
-   Coal residue in basements from original heating systems
-   Creosote buildup in chimneys
-   PCBs in old fluorescent light fixtures

Due to the construction standards of 1947, these houses were built before many modern building codes were established. The original Seattle Building Code of 1947 had minimal requirements compared to current standards, particularly regarding electrical systems, insulation, and ventilation. The presence of hazardous materials was not regulated until decades later, making proper identification and management of these materials crucial for homeowners and renovators.

The wet Washington climate has accelerated deterioration in many cases, particularly affecting wooden components and creating persistent moisture-related issues. Regular inspection and maintenance of these areas is essential for preserving these historic homes while ensuring they meet modern safety and comfort standards.
