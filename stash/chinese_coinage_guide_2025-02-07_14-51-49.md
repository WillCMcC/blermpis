### Summary

#### Early Establishment (Neolithic - Shang Dynasty)

The earliest forms of currency in China date back to the Neolithic age. During the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600-1046 BCE), cowrie shells were used as currency, valued for their rarity and portability. The use of shell money is attested to in the Chinese writing system too, due to the radical of shell being present in characters for 'goods', 'buy/sell', and 'monger'. Imitations of cowrie shells made of bone and stone indicate an early institutionalization of monetary practices. Copies of cowry shells made out of bone, wood, stone, lead and copper were common, indicating that they were used in trade. Moreover, the Chinese may have invented the first metal coins, with coins found in Anyang dating to before 900 BC.

#### Zhou Dynasty

The Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046-256 BCE) saw the diversification of currencies. Bronze objects, such as spade and knife-shaped coins, circulated alongside cowries. This reflected regional economic diversity and advancements in metalworking.

#### Warring States Period

The Warring States Period (c. 475-221 BCE) witnessed an expanded currency diversity as individual states issued their own coinages to assert economic independence. Examples included spade coins (Zhou, Wei, Han, Qin), knife money (Qi), and "ant nose" coins (Chu).

#### Qin Dynasty

Around 210 BCE, Qin Shi Huang (260-210 BCE) introduced the uniform "Ban Liang" copper coin, abolishing local currencies. Part of the Unification of China was the standardisation of coinage; the introduction of a uniform copper coin with the inscription "Ban Liang", which was round with a square hole in the middle. This standardized currency fostered economic integration and taxation simplification. Government taxes were levied on both coins and products such as rolls of silk. Salaries were paid in "stones".

#### Han Dynasty

The Han Dynasty (202 BCE - 220 CE) introduced "Wu Zhu" coins, which circulated for over 700 years. Their consistent weight and size facilitated trade, especially along the Silk Road. However, the Han also saw the use of silk, salt, and iron to supplement or substitute coinage, particularly in regions where coin circulation was limited.

#### Ancient currencies

The use of shell money is attested to in the Chinese writing system, due to the radical of shell being present in characters for 'goods', 'buy/sell', and 'monger'.

*They dynasty adopted an early prototype of paper currency starting with promissory notes in Sichuan called "flying money" (Feiqian/\u98de\u94b1).*

*During the early Song dynasty (960\u20131279), China again reunited the currency system displacing coinages from ten or so independent states. The Song dynasty saw the first true introduction of paper money as currency, and was termed Jiaozi.*

*The Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) also attempted to use paper currency. The currency issued by the Yuan was the world's first fiat currency, known as Jiaochao. The Yuan government attempted to prohibit all transactions in or possession of silver or gold, which had to be turned over to the government.*

*The early Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) also attempted to use paper currency in the early re-unification period which suspended in 1450. provincial taxes had to be remitted to the capital in silver after 1465,salt producers had to pay in silver from 1475*

*In 1889, the Chinese yuan was introduced at par with the Spanish dollar or Mexican peso or Philippine peso A significant step came in 1903 with the introduction of Kuangxu Yuanbao (\u5149\u7eea\u5143\u5b9d) coins.The earliest issues were silver coins.*

*In 1914, the National Currency Ordinance established the silver dollar as the national currency of the Republic of China. In 1935, the Nationalist government issued a new currency, the fabi.*

*The establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949 marked a turning point in the nation\u2019s monetary history. The Communist government introduced the Renminbi (\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01) as the sole legal tender.*

## Modern Era and Legacy

### Summary

#### Late Qing Dynasty to People's Republic of China

The late Qing Dynasty faced currency fragmentation with silver ingots, copper cash, and foreign coins circulating. The Chinese yuan was introduced in 1889, but the 1911 revolution left the system unstable.

#### Republic of China

The Republic of China saw further monetary disarray with warlords issuing currencies. The National Currency Ordinance established the silver dollar in 1914. In 1935, the Nationalist government issued the fabi, a fiat currency, to stabilize the economy, but WWII led to its devaluation.

#### Japanese Occupation

During the Japanese occupation, multiple puppet regimes issued their own currencies, leading to further monetary chaos. After Japan's surrender, the Nationalist government attempted to replace these currencies with the fabi, but this was met with challenges.

#### People's Republic of China

In 1949, the People's Republic of China introduced the Renminbi (RMB), unifying the currency system under the People's Bank of China, fostering stability. Reforms in the late 1970s led to a more market-oriented economy, the establishment of stock exchanges, and RMB internationalization. Mobile payments increased. There is now e-CNY.

## Insight from Arxiv Articles

### Insights from "Corpus of Chinese Dynastic Histories: Gender Analysis over Two Millennia"

While this paper's primary focus is on gender analysis, its extensive corpus of twenty-four dynastic histories (3rd century BCE - 18th century CE) provides valuable insights for coinage studies. The paper includes several key findings:

*   It could allow for the study of economic terminology related to currency, trade, and value assessments during different dynastic periods.
*   The stability of certain terms may reflect underlying economic and monetary practices.
*   A search for terms related to 'money', 'trade', 'value', or specific coin types could yield insights if integrated with numismatic data.

This analysis covered dynasties from the 3rd century BCE - 18th century CE, spanning multiple dynasties. The paper allows for potential research, namely the analysis of currency-related terms within the dynastic histories corpus to understand economic shifts and terminology evolution.

### Insights from "Flexible Computing Services for Comparisons and Analyses of Classical Chinese Poetry"

This Article discusses using poetry corpora (1046 BCE - 1644 CE) to study the history of Chinese words, collocations, and patterns. While it has no direct relation to coinage, it focuses on linguistic analysis tools and examples of comparing word preferences and historical word studies. However, the corpus may incidentally reference coins or economic activity mentioned in certain poems

### Insights from "On Mathematical Symbols in China"

This article discusses the development of mathematical symbols in China, noting a long blank period between the beginning of mathematics and modern mathematics. The lack of evolution of math symbols in China in the past might reflect how China's coinage progressed at the same time. Further analysis is required to establish this claim.

### Irrelevant Articles

The following articles were found to be not relevant to the topic of Chinese Coinage:

*   The history of the Russian study of Chinese astronomy
*   A Mathematic Expression of the Genes of Chinese Traditional Philosophy

## Conclusion

The history of coinage in China is a long and fascinating journey, reflecting the country's economic, social, and political evolution. From the early use of cowrie shells to the introduction of paper money and the modern Renminbi, Chinese coinage has undergone numerous transformations. Each dynasty brought its own innovations and challenges, shaping the monetary landscape and influencing trade both within China and across the world. Understanding this history provides valuable insights into China's rich cultural heritage and its enduring impact on global economics.
