## Buyer's Guide and Warnings

When purchasing used PC components, consider the following:
1. Always test components before completing the purchase if possible
2. Request proof of functionality through screenshots or video
3. Check for physical damage, especially on GPUs and motherboards
4. Be wary of listings with limited photos or details
5. Consider the warranty status of components
6. Meet in a safe, public location for transactions

The Portland market currently shows particularly good values on CPUs and RAM. GPU prices remain reasonable, though buyers should carefully verify the condition of used graphics cards. For the best value build, combining the Ryzen 3600 with the 1080 Ti from these listings would create a capable gaming system at a fraction of retail cost.
