Yes Madam (1985) Plot Summary:
Okay, here's a detailed plot summary of *Yes Madam* (1985), primarily focusing on what's visible on screen, suitable for inclusion in the Michelle Yeoh Movie Trivia Study Guide:

**2. Yes Madam (1985)**

**Detailed Plot Summary:**

The film opens with a bang in Hong Kong. Mr. Han, a high ranking Triad boss is being chased by the Police. During the chase, he collides into a telephone booth and drops a passport and a map with an address. The map is then stolen by petty criminal Asprin (Tsui Hark) and Strepsil (Mang Hoi). Aspiring and Strepsil are then able to steal the passport where they doctor it and sell it. Sometime passes. A man is then seen trying to open safe deposit boxes, but is later ambushed by another man.

Two police officers, Chief Inspector Ng (Michelle Yeoh) and Inspector Carrie Morris (Cynthia Rothrock), arrive in Hong Kong from London to help combat the rising crime rate. Their contrasting styles are immediately apparent. Ng is practical and focused, using her martial arts skills to efficiently subdue criminals, as seen when she breaks up a street brawl; Morris is portrayed as very physical. Inspector Ng is then tasked with apprehending the criminals but has more of a focus on the ring leader Mr. Tin. They are given the Han case.

Meanwhile, Asprin and Strepsil are attempting to sell the stolen passport. The exchange goes wrong and they are forced to run.

Asprin and Strepsil, unaware of its importance, find themselves in possession of a crucial piece of evidence: a micro-film hidden within a doctored passport Han originally dropped back at the beginning of the film. This micro-films contains the identities of corrupt bankers who have been laundering money for a powerful crime syndicate. Their possession of this micro-film makes them targets for various criminals, including members of the syndicate who want the evidence destroyed, and other gangs like Mr. Tin, who think the microfilm is proof of Han laundering money before his death, as well as the police looking for Han's black ledger that Mr. Ting hopes to find.

Mr. Tin's gang, led by the ruthless Mad Dog (Dick Wei), relentlessly pursue Asprin and Strepsil. We see them constantly trying to evade Mr. Tin's henchmen in crowded markets and narrow alleyways. During these chase sequences, objects are often thrown: tables are kicked over, bottles smashed. The intensity of the chase escalates when one of Asprin's buddies is killed at a table in a dim sum caf√©. Mad Dog and his crew are shown using brutal force. The buddy is given the micro-film but is murdered immediately. Strepsil realizes something really bad is going on with the microfilm and has it on his person.

Ng and Morris, investigating the murder, begin to connect the dots. They realize there's a connection between the original airport murder, Asprin and Strepsil, and Mr. Tin's gang. Their investigation leads them to various locations across Hong Kong, including the airport, a gambling den, the local police station, and the streets of a shopping mall.

Asprin's partner Strepsil is kidnapped and hung upside down from a high-rise building, threatened by Mad Dog, who is looking for the microfilm. Asprin panics and runs to the police station. Ng and Morris set a trap to catch the person picking up the blackmail tape.

The film culminates in a large showdown at Mr. Tin's warehouse, where Asprin and Strepsil are held captive. Ng single-handedly infiltrates the warehouse, engaging in a series of intense fights with countless henchmen. Asprin and Strepsil are trying to escape as well but are caught by Mad Dog. Ng and Morris battle Mad Dog, who is shown to be skilled in multiple fighting styles and deadly with various weapons, including knives and nunchaku. Ng is impaled with a blade, but eventually defeats Mad Dog in a very grueling fight. Morris joins in to help Ng clean up the rest of the henchman.

In the final scene, the police arrest Mr. Tin and his collaborators, bringing them to justice. The micro-film is recovered, clearing the innocent and exposing the corrupt. Asprin and Strepsil are seen battered and bruised, but alive, having learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of petty crime.

Okay, here is a detailed plot summary of *The Stunt Woman* (1996), designed for inclusion in your Michelle Yeoh Movie Trivia Study Guide. This summary focuses on details explicitly visible on screen.

## 3. **The Stunt Woman (1996)**

   - **Detailed Plot Summary**

The film opens with Ah Kam (Michelle Yeoh), a skilled but relatively unknown stuntwoman working on a large-scale action film set in Hong Kong. The visible on-screen chaos of the set is immediately apparent: explosions, people running, and carefully choreographed car crashes. The director, Sam (Sammo Hung), is constantly yelling instructions through a megaphone, and various crew members are frantically trying to keep things organized. We see Kam performing a dangerous stunt involving jumping from a height onto a moving vehicle; the stunt goes wrong when a safety cable snaps. The screen shows her hitting the windshield hard. She manages to survive with injuries, but the incident leaves her shaken and unsure.

After recovering, Ah Kam is approached by a former classmate, Alan (Alan Mak), who is now an established director aiming to film a new action movie. Alan is shown to be determined to create a project that showcases realistic stunts. He admires Kam's abilities. Kam, initially hesitant due to her earlier injury, is eventually persuaded by Alan and the prospect of more substantial work. Her face expresses doubt and trepidation, but the allure of a lead stunt role is strong.

Filming begins, initially smoothly. We see Kam executing impressive stunts, like fighting multiple opponents on a rooftop, all visible through carefully framed shots. The choreography is complex, involving leaps, falls, and precise strikes with her fists and feet. Alan pushes her to achieve perfection and realism at all costs. The film set on screen features various equipment, including cranes, harnesses, and camera rigs.

As filming progresses, Alan's obsession with realism escalates. He begins to demand increasingly dangerous stunts, blurring the lines between cinematic risk and actual safety. During a car chase sequence filmed on a bustling Hong Kong street, Kam is visibly terrified; the car swerving dangerously through traffic, narrowly missing pedestrians and other vehicles is frightening. The on-screen tension ratchets up as Alan insists on multiple takes, requiring Kam to push her physical and mental limits. This drive for perfection is causing actual risk and harm. We see Ah Kam covered in bruises and cuts on her face and arms.

Adding to the tension, news reveals that a rival director, Tong (Tsang Tsang), known for his exploitative and unsafe practices, is also working on a new action film close by. The rivalry between Alan and Tong becomes clear as they try to one-up each other with increasingly dangerous and high-profile stunts. A TV news segment shows Tong bragging about how spectacular his upcoming stunts will be, directly challenging Alan's methods.

The situation comes to a head during the filming of a particularly dangerous stunt involving a high fall onto an airbag. Alan, pressured by the competition, makes the stunt even more dangerous than originally planned, increasing the height. Before the stunt, Kam hesitates, her fear visible. During the stunt, the airbag is shown to be improperly positioned, unseen by the crew. She misses it and crashes onto the ground. Her injuries are severe, shown through visual cues such as grimacing in pain and difficulty moving. She is rushed to the hospital, where she is seen bandaged and in obvious distress.

Alan, realizing the consequences of his actions, is distraught and filled with guilt. On screen, we see him visiting Kam in the hospital, his face etched with regret as she lies in bed, heavily medicated.

While Kam recovers, further problems arise: She is diagnosed with blood cancer, and her younger sister, Ah Ting, is struggling financially. Ah Ting, whom we often see visiting Kam, is visibly worried. She is struggling with the pressure of medical bills and living expenses.

Driven by a renewed sense of purpose and a desire to help her sister, Kam decides to return to stunt work, against the advice of her doctor and friends. She takes on freelance jobs performing lower-risk stunts to earn money to support Ah Ting. These scenes show her performing smaller stunts showcasing her unwavering spirit.

The climax involves Kam accepting a particularly appealing stunt job with good pay. Unknown to her, this job is on Tong‚Äôs film set! Tong's set is visually depicted as chaotic and dangerous. Tong is shown to be a ruthless director, disregarding safety and pushing his performers irresponsibly, reflecting a clear contrast with Alan‚Äôs now-reformed view.

When Kam arrives on set, she discovers that Alan has been hired as the action director to make amends for his past actions. There's a confrontation between Kam and Alan, where she expresses both her anger at his earlier recklessness and her appreciation for his intent to make amends. The conversation is intense, filmed with close shots of their faces, emphasizing the emotional weight of their past.

The final sequence requires Kam to perform an extremely risky stunt. As she prepares, Alan, now fully committed to safety, insists on meticulous preparation. During the stunt, something goes wrong which threatens Kam ÃÅs life. Alan steps in to perform the stunt himself showing tremendous bravery; he nearly ends up getting killed.

In the end, Alan saves Kam by executing what was supposed to be her stunt using new safety protocols he implements. This act of heroism showcases his redemption. Kam visibly recovers, her physical condition improving and her relationship with Alan repaired. The final scenes show them working together on a safer set. The film concludes reinforcing industry safety standards making safety paramount.

Police Story 3: Supercop (1992) Plot Summary:
Okay, here's a detailed plot summary of *Police Story 3: Supercop* (1992) specifically focusing on details visible on the screen for inclusion in your Michelle Yeoh Movie Trivia Study Guide:

## 4. **Police Story 3: Supercop (1992)**

   - **Detailed Plot Summary**

    The film opens with Jackie Chan as *Kevin Chan Ka-Kui* (or just *Jackie* in some versions), a Hong Kong police officer, on a routine mission.  We immediately see his signature style of physical comedy as he navigates crowded streets, leaping onto a bus, and attempting to apprehend a petty thief.  The thief gets away, but Jackie's determination and acrobatic skills are immediately apparent.

    Shortly afterward, Jackie's superiors task him with a highly dangerous undercover operation. His mission is to infiltrate a powerful drug syndicate led by the ruthless *Chaibat*.  The scene cuts to a high-ranking officer briefing Jackie, showing maps and photos of key syndicate members.  It's clear that this is a huge operation involving multiple countries. The briefing room is filled with serious officers.  Jackie is then introduced to *Inspector Jessica Yang Jian-Hua* (Michelle Yeoh), a no-nonsense officer from Mainland China's Interpol department. Their contrasting styles ‚Äì Jackie's more improvisational and Jessica's strictly by-the-book ‚Äì are immediately evident through their initial dialogue and body language.

    To gain Chaibat's trust, Jackie and Jessica (posing as Jackie's sister) travel to a prison camp in mainland China.  Their plan is to break out *Panther*, a key associate of Chaibat.  We visually see the harsh conditions of the prison camp: barbed wire fences, guard towers, and drab uniforms of the prisoners. Panther is a fearsome-looking individual with numerous tattoos visible on his arms and chest.  The escape is a chaotic and destructive sequence. Jackie uses a variety of improvised weapons (sticks, rocks, tools from the prison workshop) to fight off guards.  Jessica demonstrates her own martial arts skills, taking down multiple opponents efficiently. They manage to free Panther, battling their way through the prison yard. During the escape, Jackie and Jessica work somewhat at odds as he is improvising while she prefers a set procedure. They do manage to escape though.

    The scene transitions to Hong Kong, then to Malaysia, as Jackie, Jessica, and Panther travel to meet Chaibat. The Malaysian scenery is lush.  Jackie uses his comedic charm to impress Chaibat, while Jessica remains stoic and observant.  Chaibat tests Jackie's loyalty.  This includes a demonstration of loyalty in which Chaibat orders Jackie to attack several of Chaibat's men. Jackie reluctantly does so and appears genuinely remorseful that he has to. Jackie and Jessica stay in Chaibat's elaborate mansion, filled with opulent d√©cor, security cameras, and armed guards visible throughout.

    Chaibat reveals his plans: to rescue his wife who is in custody. The team travels to Hong Kong. They participate in a daring raid on a police impound.  During the raid, Jackie, Jessica, and Chaibat's men engage in a massive shootout with Hong Kong police.  Vehicles are overturned.  Windows shatter. This showcases the sheer scale of the organization.  They successfully free Chaibat's wife.  She is portrayed as equally ruthless and cold-blooded as her husband. From the expression on her face, she enjoys making threats towards the police.

    Chaibat then needs to close a drug deal in Kuala Lumpur. The team then returns to Malaysia. During a stay at a hotel, Jackie and Jessica are beginning to trust each other. Jackie admits to Jessica that he respects her more for her bravery and determination than any of his female coworkers. He asks her on a date, but she respectfully declines. Here, Jackie is starting to show a feeling beyond just working together with Jessica Yang.

    The final act takes place in Kuala Lumpur.  Jackie and Jessica are finally exposed.  A massive confrontation ensues at a heavily guarded compound. This leads to the film's climax.  After the deal goes bad, several men in bulletproof vests gun down another member of Chaibat's gang as an example of what happens to those who betray the gang. Jackie and Jessica are immediately cornered by Chaibat and his bodyguards. First, Jessica attempts to escape while Jackie stays behind to fight a handful of Chaibat's men in a room full of gold bars. Then, Jackie and Jessica are taken hostage by Chaibat. He takes them to a sky scraper in Kuala Lumpur where the final battle breaks out.

    The fight is a series of unbelievably dangerous stunts. Jackie jumps onto a helicopter ladder hanging from a rooftop.  Jessica rides a motorcycle off a ramp onto the same helicopter. The helicopter flies through the city, skimming past buildings.  The actors are visibly risking their lives.  They are so far off the ground that their height is obvious on screen. There are many shots that show how difficult it must have been to film those scenes. The police are shown in patrol cars chasing the helicopter through the streets.

    Jackie eventually falls off of the helicopter and crashes through the roof of a building, landing in a bazaar filled with people.  Meanwhile, Jessica manages to subdue Chaibat on the helicopter and jumps onto a train, continuing the pursuit. The camera pans up to show both the train and the helicopter flying above it. In the very last scene, Jackie is shown dazed from his fall. He is now in an animal cage after falling through it from the rooftop of a building onto the ground. Jessica arrives and rescues Jackie, presumably placing Chaibat and his remaining gang members under arrest. The film ends with both characters looking on victoriously and starting a friendly relationship with each other after beginning at odds. The movie immediately goes into a montage of bloopers and other footage of stunts that were dangerous to film without the actual stunts being seen to avoid giving away the film.

   - **Key Action Sequences and Stunts**

The sheer number of extras running for cover adds to the sense of danger and pandemonium. They also show off Jackie's endurance and ability to improvise after being damaged.
     *   **Train Fight:** The use of both a land vehicle and a helicopter in proximity emphasizes the stakes of the chase. The view from above the train reveals how quickly vehicles or other characters are moving when in the middle of a stunt or chasing another person.

Okay, here is a detailed plot summary of *The Heroic Trio* (1993), focusing on details visible on screen, to fit within the study guide's requirements:

## 5. **The Heroic Trio (1993)**
   - **Detailed Plot Summary**

The film opens with a dramatic kidnapping. An **invisible man**, his body shrouded in hazy outlines, abducts newborn babies from a hospital nursery, and other nurseries as a montage shows a newspaper reports this same crime happening elsewhere. A frantic mother, Mrs. Lau, desperately pleads for her baby.

The scene then cuts to a lavish, ancient-looking fortress. Inside, an **Evil Master** (played by Lau Ching-wan, later revealed) sits on a throne-like chair in an ornate room, surrounded by loyal warriors dressed in black and gold armor. He raises a baby above his head, preparing to imbue it with special power that the invisible man has located and stolen for him.

The camera then shows a woman dressed in a long black leather coat and hat, and has a round metal shield with two handles on her back. She is later introduced and referred to as **Wonder Woman/Thief Catcher (Michelle Yeoh) (also known as Invisible Woman in some releases)**, who sneaks into a private property. Using a pair of high powered binoculars, she spies on a private party, looking for an adulterous husband her client has hired her to catch.  She skillfully uses her acrobatic fighting skills and hidden blades to defeat the guards when they inevitably discover her, and captures the philandering husband's indiscretions. She is also a loving wife to Inspector Lau (Damian Lau).

The second member of the trio is **Ching/Chun/Mercy Knives (Anita Mui)**, a bounty hunter who is seen dressed in white robes with a sword. Ching is working for the Evil Master. A flashback reveals her origin: as a young orphan, Ching was rescued and raised by the Evil Master like a daughter, trained in martial arts and brainwashed to be unquestioningly loyal.. She lives in an underground cave filled with strange gadgets and weapon displays, and is provided instructions by the only other visible loyal fighter of the Evil Master, a tall man name Kau (Paul Chun). 

The third member is **Chat/Chatter/Thief Catcher aka Invisible Girl (Maggie Cheung)** is shown as a comical character with her name literally displayed on the screen. She lives in a modest apartment, and dons heavy metal rock and roll styled clothing. She has the power of invisibility, demonstrated when she shoplifts food items from the supermarkets. She is impulsive and somewhat clumsy. During one of Chatter's petty thefts, she overhears gangsters discussing the Evil Master's plan and the missing babies. They mention Mrs. Lau, the desperate mother viewers saw at the beginning of the movie.

The three heroines' paths finally cross as they investigate the missing babies. Wonder Woman is hired by Inspector Lau to help find the babies. Ching is asked by the Evil Master to capture Mrs. Lau. Chatter gets emotionally involved due to her interaction with the Lau family.

*   **The Abandoned Shopping Mall Showdown:** Wonder Woman locates where the Evil Master ordered the kidnapped babies to be stored, and ends up fighting Ching, now revealed to be working for the villains. The fight spills into a derelict shopping mall.  They exchange graceful kicks and sword strikes amidst mannequins and broken storefronts. Wonder Woman's shield is a notable weapon throughout the fight. This displays their initial animosity and differing loyalties. Chatter arrives, using her invisibility to disrupt the fight. She is briefly captured by Ching, but rescued by Invisible woman.

*   **Mrs. Lau's Rescue:** Wonder Woman tracks Mrs. Lau, whose husband has been captured by the Evil Master henchmen, who are dressed in black suits. Wonder Woman rescues Mrs. Lau while battling the henchmen. During this fight, Wonder Woman throws her metal shield at the henchmen, and it goes off-screen to her, again and again. This displays the shield's capabilities of being thrown and finding its way back. Chatter helps to protect them with her invisibility, fighting the henchmen with her umbrella.

As the investigation progresses, it is revealed that the Evil Master intends to enthrone a new emperor from amongst the captured babies after he has selected a worthy baby. The camera shows the babies lined up along the altar. The Evil Master uses strange chanting and magical energy to test each baby's worthiness, while Kau holds each baby. The unworthy babies are then marked off in the registry for either disposal or mind-wipe training and turning into warrior fodder.

*   **Betrayal and Transformation:** Concerned about what the Evil Master is doing , Kau releases a group of children from the premises. The first child that manages to escape to the rooftops is caught by Ching and she is instructed by the Evil Master via the intercom to kill the child, as an example. Hesitating, Ching refuses and turns against the Evil Master, realizing the babies are being harmed. This is a key turning point for her character.
 She joins forces with Wonder Woman and Chatter. Together, they begin planning an assault on the Evil Master's fortress.

*   **Assault on the Fortress:** The trio launches a coordinated attack on the fortress. Wonder Woman uses her fighting skills and shield to navigate the labyrinthine corridors.  Chatter uses her invisibility to sabotage the security of the fortress.  Ching, with her knowledge of the fortress's layout, leads the way, and also using her metal claws on her fingers. The fortress is filled with traps, hidden doors, and guards armed with swords and spears.

*   **The Evil Master Revealed:** After defeating many minions, the trio confronts the Evil Master who engages in a fierce battle with the heroines using his martial arts skills and the magic power, who is revealed to be Inspector Lao's "dead" twin brother. Throughout the fight, odd power displays are exhibited from the Evil Master. He begins to display fire abilities, and then throws laser beams from his fingers. Wonder Woman is severely injured when she jumps in front to save Ching. The Evil Master attempts to kill Ching, but pauses upon seeing his adopted face on hers. The villain tries to convince the trio to join him, but the trio refuses.

*   **Sacrifice and Redemption:** During the final confrontation, Wonder Woman's shield is used to deflect the Evil Master's attacks.  Chatter employs her invisibility to create distractions. Ching uses her sword skills to strike at the Evil Master. Ultimately, Ching sacrifices herself to destroy the Evil Master and his evil plan. The final scene shows the remaining babies reunited with their parents at the hospital.  Wonder Woman recovers from her injuries, and Chatter continues her vigilante activities, now with a newfound sense of purpose.
