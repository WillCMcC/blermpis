# Expropriation Without Compensation in South Africa Summary\n\nLand reform in South Africa aims to redistribute land, including possibly white-owned businesses, to empower farm workers and reduce inequality, potentially boosting economic growth and settling land claims from apartheid-era forced removals. However, redistribution policies have faced criticism due to a 50% failure rate in land reform projects.

The Land Reform Process focuses on restitution, land tenure reform, and land redistribution. Restitution has been largely unsuccessful, shifting the focus to redistribution with secure land tenure. Initially, the government bought land from willing sellers for redistribution, but in 2000, a more decentralized, area-based planning process was introduced. This involves third parties and local elites, raising concerns about community participation.

As of 2006, the government planned to expropriate land with "just" compensation, unlike Zimbabwe's land seizures. A strategic partnership model implemented between 2005 and 2008 ended in conflict. In 2017, the ANC announced intentions to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation (EWC), granting traditional land ownership to communities. In February 2018, Parliament moved to review the constitution to allow EWC in the public interest, arguing that the land was originally seized without just compensation. In August 2018, the government began seizing white-owned farmlands at a fraction of their estimated value.

A 2016 report by the Financial and Fiscal Commission revealed that despite significant investment in land reform since 1994 (R60 billion), the program has not stimulated rural development or job creation, with many land reform farms showing little agricultural activity and significant job losses. The FFC recommended improved infrastructure, training, and consolidated funding.

In October 2019, Parliament discussed constitutional reforms for uncompensated land seizure, with President Ramaphosa committing to accelerating land redistribution in 2020 to redress historical injustices. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asserted that land distribution without compensation would be disastrous for South Africa.
