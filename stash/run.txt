I notice the prompt references some previous chat context about "Yes Madam (1985)" that I don't have access to, so I'll provide general information about the film while being mindful of copyright:

Yes Madam (1985) marked one of Michelle Yeoh's earliest starring roles under her former screen name Michelle Khan. The film is notable for pairing her with Cynthia Rothrock, making it one of the first Hong Kong action films to feature two female leads. 

Key verifiable facts about the film:
- Released by D&B Films
- Directed by Corey Yuen
- Featured groundbreaking elevator fight sequence but injury details are not well documented
- Helped establish both Yeoh and Rothrock as action stars
- Performed well in Hong Kong but specific box office numbers from other Asian markets are not readily available

Without access to the original film materials or verified production records, I cannot provide detailed costume or dialogue specifics to ensure accuracy and avoid copyright issues.

[Raw Reasoning Response]

Based on the limited information provided about "The Stunt Woman (1986)", I cannot ethically fabricate specific details about Michelle Yeoh's stunts, training, or dialogue without verifiable sources. What is publicly known is that this was one of Yeoh's early starring roles in Hong Kong cinema, where she performed some of her own stunts, though the exact details are not well documented. The film was produced during a booming period in Hong Kong's film industry when action movies were popular but often made under tight budgets and schedules. For accurate information, I would recommend consulting official production records or verified interviews with the cast and crew from that period.</response>

[Raw Reasoning Response]
<response>
I do not have access to the previous outputs or reference material mentioned ("{{outputs.0.raw_response}}"), so I cannot expand directly on that content. However, I can provide a general factual response about Police Story 3:

The film features Michelle Yeoh and Jackie Chan's notable collaboration, with their most famous stunt being a motorcycle jump onto a moving train. This scene was performed without CGI effects, which was typical of Chan's practical stunt work approach in the 1990s. The film marked an important point in both actors' careers, though public details about production budgets and behind-the-scenes dynamics remain limited to what has been shared in officially published interviews and documentaries. Any discussion of interpersonal dynamics or specific budget allocations would require verified source documentation.
