# Portland Craigslist PC Gaming Deals Report

After analyzing 202 Craigslist listings in the Portland area, I've identified several standout deals for PC gaming components. These listings were evaluated based on current market values, historical pricing data, and the components' gaming performance capabilities. Here are the most compelling deals currently available:

## Win 10 Pro Desktop 32GB RAM, Intel 10-Core CPU, 5x LAN
**Price: $150**

This is an exceptional value for a complete system. The 32GB of RAM alone would typically cost $80-100 used, and a 10-core Intel CPU (likely an i7 or i9 from the 10th generation) would normally sell for $150-200 on the secondary market. Factor in the Windows 10 Pro license ($100+ value) and the additional networking capabilities, and this system represents significant savings over purchasing components separately.

## 32GB DDR4 3600MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX
**Price: $50**

This is a stellar deal on high-performance RAM. Corsair Vengeance LPX is a reliable brand, and 3600MHz is an ideal speed for gaming systems. New, this kit typically sells for $120-140, and used prices usually hover around $80-90. At $50, this is less than half the typical market value for this specification of memory.

## EVGA 1080Ti FTW3 Video Card
**Price: $180**

The EVGA 1080 Ti FTW3 remains a capable gaming card, roughly equivalent to an RTX 2070 in many scenarios. This card still handles 1440p gaming well and can manage 4K in less demanding titles. The FTW3 variant features enhanced cooling and power delivery compared to standard 1080 Ti models. At $180, this is about $70-100 below typical used market prices for this specific model.

## Samsung U32J590UQN 31.5" 4K Monitor
**Price: $200**

This 4K monitor represents good value at $200, considering these typically sold for $300-350 new. The U32J590UQN offers solid image quality and the benefits of a large 4K panel, making it suitable for both gaming and productivity tasks.

# Buying Considerations and Warnings

When purchasing used PC components, keep these important points in mind:

1. Always test components before completing the purchase if possible
2. Request proof that components are working, such as benchmark screenshots or video demonstrations
3. Check for physical damage, especially on GPUs and monitors
4. Be wary of mining-used GPUs, which may have undergone extensive stress
5. Meet in safe, public locations for transactions
6. Keep records of serial numbers and transaction details

Currently, the Portland market shows particularly good values on memory and last-generation GPUs. The complete system deal stands out as an exceptional value, though buyers should verify the exact CPU model and overall system condition before purchasing.
