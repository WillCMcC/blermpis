# Portland Gaming PC Deals Report - Craigslist Analysis

After analyzing 202 Craigslist listings in the Portland area, I've identified several standout deals for gaming PC components. The evaluation criteria focused on comparing current market prices for both new and used hardware against the listed prices, while considering the performance and reliability of each component.

## MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 5080 16GB GDDR7

**Price: $1,900.00**

⚠️ **CAUTION**: This listing requires extreme scrutiny. The RTX 5080 series has not been officially announced by NVIDIA, making this listing highly suspicious. This is likely either a typo or potential scam. If legitimate, it would be a next-generation card, but the price is excessive even for unreleased hardware.

## 32GB DDR4 3600MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX

**Price: $50.00**

This is an exceptional deal. Corsair Vengeance LPX is a reliable, high-performance RAM series, and 3600MHz is an ideal speed for gaming systems. New, this kit typically sells for $80-120, making this price point less than half the retail cost. The high frequency and capacity make it perfect for modern gaming builds.

## Dell 800GB 2.5" NVMe SSD

**Price: $45.00**

An excellent value for a high-capacity NVMe drive. While it's a Dell OEM drive, the price-per-gigabyte ratio is outstanding. Similar capacity NVMe SSDs typically retail for $100-150 new. This would make an excellent game library drive or system drive, offering plenty of fast storage for modern games.

## Intel i7-10700K CPU

**Price: $140.00**

This 8-core, 16-thread CPU from Intel's 10th generation is still highly capable for gaming and multitasking. At $140, it's significantly below the typical used market price of ~$200. The 'K' designation means it's unlocked for overclocking, adding extra value for enthusiasts.

## ASUS ROG Graphics Card

**Price: $75.00**

While the price is low, use caution with this listing as the specific model isn't mentioned. ASUS ROG typically produces high-quality cards, but without knowing the exact model, it's impossible to determine if this is truly a good value.

## Conclusion and Buying Tips

When purchasing used PC components on Craigslist:

1. Always test components before finalizing the purchase
2. Meet in a safe, public location
3. Request proof of functionality (screenshots, benchmarks)
4. Check serial numbers for warranty status
5. Be especially cautious with high-value components like GPUs

The current Portland market shows particularly good values in memory and storage components. The CPU deal is also notable, though you'll need to factor in motherboard compatibility for a complete build.

Remember to verify all specifications in person, as listings can sometimes contain errors or misleading information, as potentially demonstrated by the RTX 5080 listing.
