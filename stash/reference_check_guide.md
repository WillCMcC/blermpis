## A Comprehensive Guide to Reference Checks and Topgrading

### 1. Introduction

Reference checks are a critical component of the hiring process, providing valuable insights into a candidate's past performance, work ethic, and overall suitability for a role. While resumes and interviews offer a glimpse into a candidate's qualifications, references offer a more objective and nuanced perspective from individuals who have directly witnessed their performance in a professional setting. Neglecting this step can lead to costly hiring mistakes, including decreased productivity, strained team dynamics, and increased employee turnover.

**The Importance of Reference Checks**

*   **Verifying Information:** Reference checks help confirm the accuracy of information presented by the candidate in their resume and during interviews. This includes verifying employment dates, job titles, and responsibilities. Discrepancies can be red flags, signaling potential dishonesty or embellishment.
*   **Assessing Performance:** References can provide concrete examples of a candidate's performance, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. Unlike self-reported assessments, reference feedback offers an external validation of a candidate's capabilities.
*   **Evaluating Cultural Fit:** Beyond skills and experience, reference checks can shed light on a candidate's ability to integrate into a team and align with the company culture. References can speak to the candidate's interpersonal skills, communication style, and overall demeanor in a professional environment.
*   **Mitigating Risk:** A thorough reference check can help identify potential risks associated with hiring a particular candidate. This includes uncovering past performance issues, behavioral concerns, or other red flags that may not be apparent during the initial screening process.
*   **Improving Hiring Decisions:** By gathering comprehensive feedback from multiple references, hiring managers can make more informed and confident hiring decisions. Reference checks provide a holistic view of the candidate, complementing the information gathered through other stages of the hiring process.

**Introduction to Topgrading**

Topgrading is a comprehensive hiring methodology focused on identifying and recruiting high-performing individuals. This approach emphasizes a rigorous and structured process for assessing candidates, with reference checks playing a central role. Topgrading aims to minimize hiring mistakes by thoroughly evaluating a candidate's past performance and predicting their future success within the organization.

### 4. Topgrading Techniques

**What is Topgrading?**

Topgrading is a hiring methodology developed by Bradford Smart that aims to identify and hire top talent by thoroughly evaluating a candidate's career history. Unlike traditional hiring approaches that focus primarily on skills and experience, topgrading delves deeper into a candidate's past performance, motivations, and overall fit within the organization. The central premise of topgrading is that past performance is the best predictor of future success.

At its core, topgrading involves a structured and rigorous process of assessing candidates, with a heavy emphasis on in-depth interviews and thorough reference checks. The methodology encourages hiring managers to engage in open and honest conversations with candidates about their career history, exploring both their successes and failures. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the candidate's strengths, weaknesses, and overall track record.

A key component of topgrading is the Chronological In-depth Structured Interview (CISI). This interview format guides the interviewer through the candidate's entire work history, starting with their earliest jobs and progressing to their present role. For each position, the interviewer asks detailed questions about the candidate's responsibilities, accomplishments, challenges, and relationships with managers and colleagues. This comprehensive approach allows the interviewer to identify patterns in the candidate's performance and gain a deeper understanding of their capabilities and motivations

The information gathered through the CISI is then validated through reference checks. Topgrading emphasizes the importance of speaking with multiple references, including former managers, colleagues, and even subordinates. These reference checks are not simply cursory confirmations of employment dates and job titles; instead, they involve in-depth conversations designed to uncover specific examples of the candidate's performance, work ethic, and overall fit.
By combining the insights from the CISI with thorough reference checks, topgrading aims to provide a comprehensive and objective assessment of each candidate. This approach helps hiring managers to identify top performers who are not only qualified for the role but also likely to thrive within the organization's culture.
In essence, topgrading is a commitment to making informed and strategic hiring decisions by thoroughly vetting each candidate and aligning their capabilities with the specific needs of the organization. It's a rigorous process, but the results are reduced turnover, increased productivity, and a stronger, more effective workforce.

**Techniques Related to Topgrading**

*   **Chronological In-depth Structured Interview (CISI):** As described, this involves a comprehensive review of the candidate's entire work history, focusing on accomplishments, failures, and key learnings from each role. The objective to get a full picture of their career trajectory.
*   **Career History Form:** Candidates are asked to complete a detailed form outlining their entire work history, including job titles, responsibilities, accomplishments, and reasons for leaving each position. This form serves as a foundation for the in-depth interview.
*   **Threat of Reference Check:** Early in the interview process, candidates are informed that their references will be thoroughly checked. This encourages them to be honest and transparent about their past performance.
*   **Reference Call Guide:** A standardized template for conducting reference calls, ensuring that consistent questions are asked of all references. This helps to ensure a fair and objective evaluation of each candidate.
*   **"Tell Me About Your Biggest Accomplishments and Failures"**: This questioning focuses on results to measure impact and identify what the candidate learned in the process.
*   **The "Who" Method**: Asking candidates who the best people they have worked with are, and why. Look for those that surround themselves with quality.
*   **Assessing Cultural Fit:** Evaluating whether the candidate's values, work style, and personality align with the organization's culture. This is crucial for long-term success and retention.
*   **"The Topgrading Interview"**: A structured interview that involves a review of the candidate's career history, including job titles, accomplishments, failures, and reasons for leaving each position.
*   **The importance of getting feedback from multiple references**: Speak with at least three references, including former managers, peers, and subordinates, to get a well-rounded view of the candidate's performance.
*   **Focusing on specific examples**: Ask references to provide concrete examples of the candidate's behavior and performance, rather than relying on general impressions or opinions.
By incorporating these topgrading techniques into the hiring process, organizations can improve their chances of making successful hiring decisions and building a high-performing workforce.

Now that we understand the importance of reference checks and the topgrading methodology, let's delve into the practical aspects of preparing for and conducting effective reference calls.

### 2. Preparing for the Reference Call

Thorough preparation is paramount to conducting effective reference calls. This stage sets the foundation for gleaning insightful and actionable information about the candidate. The key is to be strategic and targeted in your approach.

*   **Reviewing the Candidate's Resume and Interview Notes**

    Before picking up the phone, dedicate time to thoroughly analyze all available information on the candidate. This includes:

    *   **Resume/CV:** Scrutinize the candidate's work history, paying close attention to:

        *   **Job Titles and Responsibilities:** Understand the scope of their previous roles and the specific duties they performed. Look for any inconsistencies or ambiguities that warrant clarification.
        *   **Dates of Employment:** Verify the start and end dates for each position to ensure accuracy. Discrepancies can be a red flag.
        *   **Achievements and Accomplishments:** Identify any quantifiable achievements or specific accomplishments the candidate has highlighted. These will be valuable discussion points during the reference call.
        *   **Skills and Qualifications:** Note the skills listed on the resume and compare them to the requirements of the target position.

    *   **Interview Notes:** Review your notes from all interviews conducted with the candidate. This will help you:

        *   **Identify Strengths and Weaknesses:** Refresh your memory on the candidate's self-identified strengths and weaknesses. This will allow you to explore these areas further with the reference.
        *   **Recall Specific Examples:** Remind yourself of the specific examples the candidate provided to support their claims. You can then ask the reference to corroborate these examples or offer their own perspective.
        *   **Note Any Concerns or Questions:** Highlight any concerns or unanswered questions that arose during the interview process. Use the reference call as an opportunity to address these issues.
        *   **Assess Cultural Fit:** Consider how the candidate's personality and work style align with the company culture based on your interview observations. This is an important aspect to explore with the reference.

*   **Identifying Key Areas to Probe**

    Based on your review of the resume and interview notes, identify 3-5 key areas to probe during the reference call. These areas should be directly relevant to the requirements of the target position and should address any concerns or uncertainties you have about the candidate. Some examples of key areas to probe include:

    *   **Technical Skills:** If the position requires specific technical skills, focus on verifying the candidate's proficiency in these areas. Ask the reference for specific examples of how the candidate has applied these skills in the past.
    *   **Leadership Abilities:** For management roles, explore the candidate's leadership style, ability to motivate and inspire others, and experience in managing teams.
    *   **Problem-Solving Skills:** Assess the candidate's ability to analyze problems, develop solutions, and make sound decisions. Ask the reference for examples of challenging situations the candidate has successfully navigated.
    *   **Communication Skills:** Evaluate the candidate's written and verbal communication skills, as well as their ability to communicate effectively with different audiences.
    *   **Teamwork and Collaboration:** Determine how well the candidate works as part of a team, their ability to collaborate with others, and their contribution to team goals.
    *   **Adaptability and Flexibility:** Assess the candidate's ability to adapt to changing priorities, learn new skills, and handle unexpected challenges.
    *   **Work Ethic and Reliability:** Explore the candidate's work ethic, attendance record, and overall reliability.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:** Do not shy away from asking about areas where the candidate could improve. This demonstrates a desire for a balanced and realistic assessment.

    By identifying these key areas in advance, you can ensure that your reference call is focused and productive. Prepare specific questions related to each area to guide the conversation.

### 3. Conducting the Reference Call

The way you conduct the reference call is crucial to obtaining honest and valuable feedback. Approach each call with professionalism, respect, and a clear understanding of your goals.

*   **Establishing Rapport: Introducing Yourself and the Purpose of the Call**

    Start the call by establishing rapport with the reference. This will help to create a comfortable and trusting environment, making them more likely to provide candid feedback.

    *   **Introduce Yourself:** Clearly state your name, title, and the company you represent.
    *   **Explain the Purpose of the Call:** Briefly explain that you are conducting a reference check for a candidate who has applied for a position at your company. Assure the reference that any information they provide will be kept confidential.
    *   **Thank the Reference for Their Time:** Acknowledge that the reference's time is valuable and express your appreciation for their willingness to speak with you.
    *   **Confirm Their Relationship to the Candidate:** Verify the reference's relationship to the candidate (e.g., former manager, supervisor, colleague).
    *   **Set Expectations:** Briefly outline the types of information you are hoping to gather during the call.

    Example:

    "Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'm a [Your Title] at [Your Company]. I'm calling to conduct a reference check for [Candidate Name], who has applied for a [Job Title] position with us. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. I understand you were [Candidate Name]'s manager at [Previous Company]? I'm hoping to learn more about [Candidate Name]'s skills, experience, and work style to help us assess their suitability for the role. All information you provide will be kept confidential."

*   **Verifying Information: Confirming Dates of Employment and Job Titles**

    Before delving into more substantive questions, begin by verifying the basic information provided by the candidate on their resume. This ensures accuracy and can uncover any discrepancies.

    *   **Confirm Dates of Employment:** Ask the reference to confirm the start and end dates of the candidate's employment at their company.
    *   **Verify Job Titles:** Confirm the candidate's job titles held during their employment.
    *   **Clarify Reporting Structure:** Understand who the candidate reported to and their position within the team.
    *   **Responsibilities Overview:** Briefly ask the reference to describe the candidate's main responsibilities in their role.

    Example Questions:

    *   "Can you please confirm the dates [Candidate Name] worked at [Previous Company]?"
    *   "What was [Candidate Name]'s job title during their time at [Previous Company]?"
    *   "To whom did [Candidate Name] report?"
    *   "Could you briefly describe [Candidate Name]'s main responsibilities in that role?"

*   **Probing for Specific Examples: Using the STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**

    To gain a deeper understanding of the candidate's skills and experience, it is essential to move beyond generalities and ask for specific examples. The STAR method is a powerful technique for eliciting detailed and insightful responses.

    The STAR method involves asking the reference to describe a **Situation** the candidate faced, the **Task** they were assigned, the **Action** they took, and the **Result** of their efforts. This structured approach helps the reference provide a comprehensive and contextualized account of the candidate's performance.

    When using the STAR method, frame your questions to encourage the reference to think about specific situations and provide concrete examples.

    Example Questions:

    *   "Can you describe a time when [Candidate Name] faced a challenging problem at work? What was the situation?"
    *   "What specific task was [Candidate Name] assigned in that situation?"
    *   "What actions did [Candidate Name] take to address the problem?"
    *   "What was the result of [Candidate Name]'s actions? What impact did they have?"
    *   "Can you give me an example of a time when [Candidate Name] demonstrated excellent teamwork skills?"
    *   "Tell me about a time when [Candidate Name] had to deal with a difficult client or customer."
    *   "Describe a situation where [Candidate Name] had to make a difficult decision."

*   **Conversational Tips**

    The way you phrase your questions can significantly influence the quality and candor of the responses you receive. Use a mix of positive, negative, and neutral questions to gain a well-rounded perspective on the candidate.

    *   **Positive Questions:** These questions focus on the candidate's strengths and accomplishments. They are helpful for identifying the candidate's key contributions and areas of expertise.

        Example Questions:

        *   "What were [Candidate Name]'s greatest strengths?"
        *   "What were some of [Candidate Name]'s most significant accomplishments at [Previous Company]?"
        *   "What did you appreciate most about working with [Candidate Name]?"
        *   "What were [Candidate Name]'s key contributions to the team?"
        *   "In what areas did [Candidate Name] excel?"
        *   "What unique skills or talents did [Candidate Name] bring to the table?"

    *   **Negative Questions:** These questions explore areas where the candidate could improve or areas of concern. They are essential for identifying potential weaknesses or red flags. Frame these questions carefully to avoid sounding accusatory or judgmental.

        Example Questions:

        *   "What are some areas where [Candidate Name] could improve?"
        *   "What were some of the challenges you faced while managing [Candidate Name]?"
        *   "What advice would you give to [Candidate Name]'s future manager?"
        *   "What are some things [Candidate Name] could have done differently?"
        *   "Were there any performance issues that needed to be addressed?" (Frame this carefully and only if appropriate)
        *   "If you could change one thing about [Candidate Name]'s performance, what would it be?"

    *   **Neutral Questions:** These questions are open-ended and unbiased, allowing the reference to provide their honest assessment without being influenced by your preconceived notions.

        Example Questions:

        *   "How would you describe [Candidate Name]'s work ethic?"
        *   "How would you describe [Candidate Name]'s communication skills?"
        *   "How would you describe [Candidate Name]'s ability to work under pressure?"
        *   "How would you describe [Candidate Name]'s problem-solving skills?"
        *   "How would you describe [Candidate Name]'s leadership style?"
        *   "How did [Candidate Name] handle conflict within the team?"
        *   "In what type of work environment does [Candidate Name] thrive?"
        *   "How did [Candidate Name] adapt to changing priorities?"
        *   "What is your overall impression of [Candidate Name]?"
        *   "Would you rehire [Candidate Name]? Why or why not?" (This is a crucial question!)

    By strategically using a combination of positive, negative, and neutral questions, you can gather a comprehensive and balanced assessment of the candidate's suitability for the role. Remember to listen attentively to the reference's responses and ask follow-up questions to clarify any ambiguities or explore any areas of concern.

Building on these techniques, let's investigate some specific questions to aid the reference check.

While asking the right questions is crucial, it's equally important to be aware of potential red flags that may surface during the reference check process.

### 6. Red Flags to Watch For

During the reference check process, be alert for certain red flags that may indicate potential concerns about the candidate. These red flags don't necessarily disqualify a candidate, but they warrant further investigation and consideration.

### Hesitation

Hesitation before answering a question can signal discomfort or uncertainty. It may indicate that the reference is trying to avoid providing a negative answer or is unsure about the accuracy of their information. Pay close attention to the questions that elicit hesitation and probe further to understand the underlying reason.

### Vagueness

Vague or generic responses that lack specific details can also be a red flag. If the reference struggles to provide concrete examples or quantifiable results, it may suggest that the candidate's performance was not as strong as presented. Ask follow-up questions to encourage the reference to provide more specific information.

### Defensiveness

A defensive tone or attitude from the reference may indicate that they are trying to protect the candidate or downplay any negative aspects of their performance. If the reference becomes argumentative or refuses to answer certain questions, it may be a sign that they are not being entirely forthcoming.

### Overly positive or negative responses

While positive feedback is desirable, excessively glowing reviews without any mention of areas for improvement can be suspicious. Similarly, overly negative responses without any acknowledgment of the candidate's strengths should also be treated with caution. Look for balanced and objective assessments that provide a comprehensive picture of the candidate's performance.

Specifically:

*   An overly positive reference, without examples, can be a sign that the referee may not be objective
*   An overly negative reference, without examples, can similarly indicate a biased opinion.
*   A reluctance to provide specific examples or quantifiable data to support claims
*   Inconsistencies between the information provided by the candidate and the reference
*   An inability to verify dates of employment or job titles
*   Concerns about the candidate's ethical behavior or integrity
*   Evidence of performance issues, such as missed deadlines, poor quality work, or conflicts with colleagues
*   A negative or unprofessional attitude towards the candidate or the previous employer
*   Any indication of legal or compliance issues involving the candidate
*   Overall, trust your instincts. If something doesn't feel right or if you have a gut feeling that something is amiss, investigate further. Follow up with the candidate or other references to gather more information and address any concerns. Thorough reference checking is essential for making informed hiring decisions and minimizing the risk of costly hiring mistakes.

After gathering all of this information, it is essential it is accurately assessed according to a clear process.

### 7. Documenting and Evaluating References

The value of a reference check is directly proportional to how well the information gathered is documented and then used to evaluate the candidate. Casual notes scribbled during a phone call are insufficient. A structured approach ensures consistency, facilitates comparison between candidates, and minimizes bias.

### Creating a Structured Format for Recording Reference Feedback

Before making any reference calls, design a template to capture the information in a standardized way. This template should include the following sections:

*   **Candidate Information:** Full name of the candidate and the position they are applying for.

*   **Reference Information:**
    *   Reference's Name:
    *   Reference's Title:
    *   Reference's Company:
    *   Reference's Relationship to Candidate: (e.g., direct manager, peer, subordinate)
    *   Date of Reference Check:
    *   Contact Information: (Phone number and/or email address of the reference)

*   **Employment Verification:**
    *   Dates of Employment: (Confirm start and end dates)
    *   Job Title(s) Held: (List all titles held during their tenure)
    *   Reporting Structure: (Who did the candidate report to?)
    *   Reason for Leaving: (Verify the candidate's stated reason)

*   **Detailed Feedback:** This is the core of the documentation. Create sections that align with the key areas you are probing, such as:
    *   **Overall Performance:** (Summarize the reference's overall impression of the candidate's performance.)
    *   **Strengths:** (List the candidate's key strengths as identified by the reference, with specific examples.)
    *   **Weaknesses:** (List the candidate's areas for improvement as identified by the reference, with specific examples.)
    *   **Skills & Competencies:** (Dedicate sections for the specific skills and competencies required for the role, such as communication, leadership, technical skills, problem-solving, etc. Record the reference's assessment along with supporting examples.)
    *   **Teamwork & Collaboration:** (Record how well the candidate worked with others, their contribution to team projects, and any conflicts or challenges they faced.)
    *   **Work Ethic & Reliability:** (Assess the candidate's punctuality, attendance, commitment to deadlines, and overall reliability.)
    *   **Initiative & Problem Solving:** (Note examples of the candidate taking initiative, identifying problems, and developing solutions.)
    *   **Adaptability & Learning Agility:** (Record how well the candidate adapted to new situations, learned new skills, and responded to feedback.)
    *   **Management Potential:** (If applicable, assess the candidate's potential for leadership and management roles.)
    *   **Areas for Follow-Up:** (Note any areas where further clarification or investigation is needed during subsequent interviews or reference checks.)

*   **Notes:** A section for capturing any additional information, observations, or nuances that don't fit neatly into the other categories. This might include the reference's tone, hesitation, or any other subjective impressions.

*   **Overall Recommendation:** A summary of whether the reference would recommend the candidate for a similar role.

For each section, use open-ended questions that encourage the reference to provide detailed answers and specific examples. Record the reference's responses verbatim as much as possible. Quotations can be very helpful in capturing the nuances of their feedback.

### Rating Candidates Based on Reference Feedback

Once you have completed the reference checks, the next step is to evaluate the feedback and compare candidates. A rating system can help to standardize this process and make it more objective.

*   **Define Rating Scale:** Create a clear and consistent rating scale for each key area (e.g., performance, teamwork, skills). A common scale is a 5-point scale:
    *   5 - Exceeds Expectations: Consistently surpasses expectations and delivers exceptional results.
    *   4 - Meets Expectations: Consistently meets expectations and performs at a high level.
    *   3 - Partially Meets Expectations: Generally meets expectations, but may have some areas for improvement.
    *   2 - Does Not Meet Expectations: Frequently fails to meet expectations and requires significant improvement.
    *   1 - Unsatisfactory: Consistently performs below expectations and demonstrates significant deficiencies.

*   **Apply Ratings Consistently:** Review the documented feedback for each candidate and assign a rating for each key area based on the reference's comments and examples. Be as objective as possible and avoid letting personal biases influence your ratings.

*   **Calculate Overall Score:** Once you have assigned ratings for each key area, you can calculate an overall score for each candidate. This can be a simple average of the ratings, or you can weight certain areas based on their importance to the role.

*   **Compare Candidates:** Compare the overall scores and individual ratings for each candidate. This will help you to identify the top candidates and those who may have potential red flags.

*   **Consider Multiple References:** It's essential to consider feedback from multiple references for each candidate. Look for patterns and inconsistencies in the feedback. If there are significant discrepancies between references, investigate further to understand the reasons for the differences.

*   **Document Your Rationale:** For each candidate, document your overall assessment and the rationale behind your ratings. This will help to justify your hiring decision and provide valuable feedback for the candidate.
