## Yes, Madam (1985) Study Guide

**Plot Summary:** Police officers Senior Inspector Ng (Michelle Yeoh) and Inspector Carrie Morris (Cynthia Rothrock) are separately investigating a series of murders connected to a powerful crime syndicate. Ng is a by-the-book Hong Kong cop known for her martial arts skills and dedication to justice. Morris is a British officer, recently transferred to Hong Kong, known for her more aggressive and less conventional methods.

The film opens with a shady business transaction involving Mr. Tin, a criminal attempting to sell a miniature printing plate containing information vital to the syndicate. He hides the plate inside a toy doll. Two petty thieves, Asprin and Strepsil, steal the doll, unaware of its importance.

Tin is murdered, kicking off the investigation. Ng and Morris are assigned to the case, and their contrasting styles immediately create friction. Despite their differences, they recognize the need to work together.

Asprin and Strepsil become targets of the crime syndicate, led by the ruthless Mr. Han. Han dispatches his henchmen to retrieve the doll, leading to several comedic and action-packed encounters with the bumbling thieves. Asprin and Strepsil realize the doll is valuable but don't understand why. They try to sell it, attracting unwanted attention.

Ng and Morris begin their investigation by questioning known associates of Mr. Tin. Their investigation leads them to a nightclub owned by Han, where they encounter resistance and engage in a brawl with his thugs. The fight showcases their impressive martial arts skills.

Meanwhile, Asprin and Strepsil seek refuge at the home of their friend, Panadol. Panadol inadvertently discovers the printing plate but remains unaware of its significance. Han's men eventually track them down, leading to a chaotic fight at Panadol's apartment. Ng and Morris arrive, intervening and saving the trio from Han's henchmen. Asprin, Strepsil, and Panadol are taken into police custody as witnesses.

While in custody, Asprin blabs, revealing the existence of the doll. Ng and Morris piece together the connection between the doll, Mr. Tin's murder, and the crime syndicate. They realize the printing plate contains crucial information that could expose the entire organization.

Han becomes desperate and intensifies his efforts to retrieve the plate. He resorts to increasingly violent tactics, targeting anyone connected to the case. He orchestrates an attack on the police station in an attempt to kill Asprin, Strepsil, and Panadol. Ng and Morris fight valiantly to defend the station, showcasing their martial prowess against overwhelming odds.

During the attack on the police station, Panadol manages to escape with the doll. He attempts to sell it again, leading him into further trouble. He unknowingly sells it to Han's men, but the plate is missing; Panadol had removed it prior to the sale.

Ng and Morris finally confront Han at his headquarters, a heavily guarded warehouse. An extended and brutal fight ensues. Ng and Morris battle their way through hordes of henchmen, demonstrating their incredible fighting skills and teamwork. Asprin and Strepsil, having escaped police custody, arrive to help, using their ineptitude to their advantage and inadvertently creating diversions.

The final showdown takes place between Ng, Morris, and Han. Han proves to be a formidable opponent, but Ng and Morris ultimately defeat him, using their combined skills. They recover the printing plate, exposing the crime syndicate's operations. Han is arrested.

In the aftermath, Asprin, Strepsil, and Panadol are released, presumably with a reward for their unintentional assistance. Ng and Morris, having overcome their initial differences, develop a grudging respect for each other. The film concludes with them acknowledging their successful partnership, hinting at future collaborations. The crime syndicate is dismantled, and justice is served.

## The Stunt Woman (1996) Study Guide

**Plot Summary:** Samantha 'Sam' Kendall, a talented but underappreciated stuntwoman, works on low-budget action films, constantly battling sexism and seeking recognition for her skills. Her boyfriend, fellow stunt performer Jake Munroe, is supportive but often pushes her to take bigger risks.

The film opens with Sam performing a dangerous car stunt on the set of a low-budget action film titled "Maximum Impact." After nailing the stunt, the director barely acknowledges her efforts, focusing solely on the film's star, Nick Stratton, a vain and arrogant actor who performs none of his own stunts. Sam voices her frustration to Jake about the lack of respect and her dream of directing her own action film, "Road Warriors."

Later, at a bar frequented by stunt performers, Sam argues with Nick, who dismisses stunt work as simple and unskilled. Jake attempts to defuse the situation, but the tension remains. Sam reveals to Jake that she's been working on the script for "Road Warriors" in her spare time. He encourages her to pursue it, but reminds her of the financial realities of independent filmmaking.

The next day on set, a dangerous high-fall stunt goes wrong. The safety equipment malfunctions due to negligence by a disgruntled crew member, and Sam is injured. While her injury is not life-threatening, the incident shakes her confidence and reinforces her feelings of being undervalued.

While recovering, Sam attends a meeting of a stunt performers' union, where she learns about the rampant safety violations and exploitation within the industry. Inspired, she decides to take a more active role in advocating for stunt performer safety. She also begins to aggressively pursue funding for "Road Warriors."

A wealthy and influential film producer, Larry Wilcox, takes an interest in Sam's script and her stunt expertise. He offers to finance "Road Warriors," but his interest quickly veers into unwanted advances. Sam rebuffs his sexual harassment, jeopardizing the funding for her film. Wilcox retaliates by blacklisting her in the industry.

Devastated by Wilcox's actions, Sam finds herself struggling to find work. Jake tries to support her, but their relationship becomes strained due to the pressure and Sam's increasing frustration. Jake accepts a dangerous stunt job out of state, hoping to earn enough money to help finance "Road Warriors."

While Jake is away, Sam investigates Wilcox's business dealings. She discovers that he has a history of exploiting stunt performers and covering up safety violations on his film sets. She gathers evidence with the help of her friends in the stunt community, planning to expose Wilcox's corruption.

Jake returns early and injured from his latest stunt. He reveals that the safety conditions on set were deliberately compromised, and he suspects Wilcox was involved. This strengthens Sam's resolve to take down Wilcox.

Sam and her friends plan a daring sting operation. They infiltrate Wilcox's latest film set, "Cyber Strike," posing as stunt performers. During a complex action sequence involving explosions and vehicle chases, they secretly record Wilcox admitting to his exploitative practices and deliberately endangering stunt performers for profit.

As part of the sting, Sam performs an incredibly dangerous stunt – a motorcycle jump over a moving train – which she executes flawlessly. However, Wilcox, realizing he's been exposed, attempts to sabotage the stunt, putting Sam in mortal danger.

Jake, seeing what's happening, rushes to Sam's rescue. He performs a daring counter-stunt, diverting the train and saving Sam's life. In the process, Wilcox is apprehended by the authorities.

With Wilcox's corruption exposed, Sam's reputation is restored. She secures funding for "Road Warriors" and begins pre-production, finally realizing her dream of directing her own action film. The film ends with Sam and Jake, their relationship strengthened by their shared experiences, preparing to embark on their new adventure, with Sam in the director's chair.
