You are an expert technical writer with deep knowledge of the Linux kernel. Generate a detailed table of contents for a comprehensive guide to the Linux kernel, targeting experienced software engineers and computer science students. The guide should explain the core subsystems and architecture of the kernel. Include a minimum of 10 sections with sub-sections for each. Focus on maintainability and readability. Include the relevant directory structure to explain the major subsystems and their organization.

The structure should be expressed as a JSON object with a "title" and a "sections" array where each section has a "title" and optionally a "subsections" array.  The final section should include a resources section with links to the source code repository to view. Sample format below:

```json
{
  "title": "The Linux Kernel: A Comprehensive Guide",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Introduction to the Linux Kernel",
      "subsections": [
        {
          "title": "What is the Linux Kernel?"
        },
        {
          "title": "Kernel Architecture"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Process Management",
      "subsections":[
        {
          "title": "Scheduling"
        }
